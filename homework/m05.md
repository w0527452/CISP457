An entity is like a noun - person, place, thing or event, about which data is collected and stored.

Stored info:  

* Name

* Notes


### 5\. Define what is meant by an attribute in a data model. How should an attribute be named? What information about an attribute should be stored in the CASE repository?

### 7\. A team of developers is considering including “warehouse” as an entity in its data model. The company for whom they are developing the system has just one warehouse location. Should “warehouse” be included? Why or why not?

### 9\. Describe, in terms a businessperson could understand, what are meant by the cardinality and modality of a relationship between two entities.

They both refer to quantitive relationships between entities.  Cardinality refers to the number of entities allowed in both directions - one to one, one to many, many to many.

Modality refers to the ability of one entity to exist depending on the existence of the related entity.  This is either null or not null, or required or optional.
