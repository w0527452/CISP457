## Pg 31 Question 1-7

1\. List and describe the six general skills all project team members should have.

a\. Technical - to understand existing tech, proposed tech, and how they can be integrated.

b\. Business - to understand what business problems IT can solve and make sure it actually provides value.

c\. Analytical - ability to solve problems on many levels.

d\. Interpersonal - ability to communicate effectively with people with varying degrees of technical skills and knowledge.

e\. Management - ability to manage co-workers and suborinates, as well as the associated pressures and risks.

f\. Ethical - responsiblity for doing what is fair and right, even when nobody's looking.



2\. What are the major roles on a project team?  

a\. Systems Analyst  
b\. Business Analyst  
c\. Requirements Analyst  
d\. Infrastructure Analyst  
e\. Change Management Analyst  
f\. Project Manager  

3\. Compare and contrast the role of a systems analyst, business analyst, and infrastructure analyst.  

While all 3 need to be able to maintain an understanding of the big picture, each role is more granular its own area of responsiblity.  Each will have their own priorities but they must be aware of how they can best interact with the others.

4\. Compare and contrast the role of requirements analyst, change management analyst, and project manager.

All roles will have an eye on each other to a degree.  Requirements may be responsible for initial requirements, Change Management will need to be able to adjust based on different factors over time, and both will need to report to Project Manager so they can hopefully keep things on track, making their own adjustment over time.

5\. Describe the major phases in the systems development life cycle (SDLC).  

a\. Planning - determines the value, feasibility, and a general structure of a project.  

b\. Analysis - what it should do and who will use it and how.  Information gathering to determine requirements and initial design.

c\. Development - decide how the system will be uses, what information it needs to store, who needs that information, best tech to use, how it interacts with existing system(s), whether needs to built from scratch or customize available solution...

d\. Implementation - build, test, and put the system to use, monitor system and users, identify necessary changes, provide tech support... 

6\. Describe the principal steps in the planning phase. What are the major deliverables?  

Identify opportunity/value, analyze feasibility, develop plan, staff project.  
Deliverables - System request, feasibilty study, project and staffing plans, risk assesment

7\. Describe the principal steps in the analysis phase. What are the major deliverables?  

Develop strategy to understand and tackle project, discover business and tech requirements, create use cases to cover all bases, develop necessary structure for data and processes.  
Deliverables - System proposal, requirements definition, use cases, and process and data models.

D\. Car dealers have realized how profitable it can be to sell automobiles by using the Web. Pretend that you work for a local car dealership that is part of a large chain such as CarMax.  Create a system request that you might use to develop a Web-based sales system. Remember to list special issues that are relevant to the project.

System Request - Web-Bases Auto Sales

Business Need: This creates the ability of customers to initiate the purchase of a new automobile using our website.  While this will still require human interaction it will draw in additional customers who may otherwise not be in the market for a new car/truck.

Business Requirements: This requires a website with access to our inventory databses, a team to manage the website, and employees to complete the sale.  Customers can browse the website, find a car they're interested in, provide a ton of personal information that we'll use to gauge their ability to pay before we sell that information to third parties, and we'll either hand them off to a third party to handle the financing or we could handle that ourselves with more technical investment.

Business Value: This will provide sales income above and beyond that being generated by our team of salesmen already preying on customers who wander into the lot.



E\. Think about your own university or college and choose an idea that could improve student satisfaction with the course enrollment process. Currently, can students enroll for classes from anywhere? How long does it take? Are directions simple to follow? Is online help available? Next, think about how technology can help support your idea. Would you need completely new technology? Can the current system be changed?

Create a system request that you could give to the administration that explains the sponsor, business need, business requirements, and potential value of the project.  Include any constraints or issues that should be considered.

System Request - Cloud-based Course Reviews

Business Need: Create the ability of prospective students to learn about the course experience instead of only its requirements.  Course descriptions provide little insight into how courses are run or what students can expect, especially for online courses.  An online repository of student experiences could be accessed by web or mobile app.

Business Value: The ability to read other students' experiences before enrolling may decrease the overhead required when students discover the course "isn't for them" and decide to drop the course and enroll in something else.



F\. Think about the idea that you developed in Exercise E to improve your university or college course enrollment process.  List three things that influence the technical feasibility of the system, the economic feasibility of the system, and the organizational feasibility of the system. How can you learn more about the issues that affect the three kinds of feasibility? 

1\. Terrible idea having even the slightest knowledge of human nature.  
2\. May decrease overall enrollment in courses based on the ravings of lazy and discontented students.  
3\. Has the potential to harm the reputation of decent people.  

If you need to learn more about these issues you could always peruse facebook or twitter.  Just because we can doesn't mean we should.  



G\. Amazon.com was very successful when it decided to extend its offerings beyond books to many other products. Amazon.com was unable to compete successfully with eBay.comâ€™s auction site, however, and eventually abandoned its own auction site. What feasibility factors probably had the most significance in this failure? Explain.  

I was almost surprised to discover there was ever such a thing as Amazon Auctions.  I say 'almost' becuase I was drunk from the 80's through March of 2019 and I missed a lot of things.  I'd have to guess the largest feasibility problem was organizational.  Neither the sellers nor the buyers behaved as Amazon had expected they would.  One article I read actually mentioned the problem I joked about in Exercise F, above:  
```Cameraworld had another reason for pulling out of Amazon Auctions: the risk of unchecked feedback on the site.```  

```"People were bidding $100 on a pair of binoculars that go for $10,000, and they get upset and post commentary,"```

They had the technical feasibility covered and the economic feasibilty I'm sure seemed like a no-brainer.  But that darn human nature...
